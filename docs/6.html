                        In words it sounds like this: right bang-bang, interception to the right (green center in front
                        of you) left bang-bang and then usually arrange the edges. Congratulations, after arranging all
                        the edges in the second layer, the cube is assembled by 60 percent. Less than half of it reaches
                        this stage, so if you managed it, then you are great and your Rubik's cube will soon be
                        assembled.
