                        F' . Please note that if you have a "half cross", you need to hold it at 9 o'clock so that one
                        arrow looks to the left and the second one looks up. And if it's a stick, then hold it
                        horizontally and only then do the algorithm. If you initially had a dot, it will turn into a
                        half cross, if it was a half cross, they will turn into a stick, and if it was a stick, then
                        into a cross.

                        <b>Attention!</b>
                        If you have 1 or 3 elements looking up at the same time and you do not see any of the figures
                        shown, your cube could have been disassembled into parts and incorrectly assembled (accidentally
                        or as a joke). In this case, you will not assemble the cube according to the formulas. We
                        strongly recommend that you disassemble the cube into parts and assemble it by colors
                        mechanically.
