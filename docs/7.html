                        stage, we turn the cube over again with the yellow color facing up. The sequence for creating a
                        yellow cross is as follows: dot → half a cross (nine o'clock) → stick → cross You may already
                        have a whole cross assembled on your cube. But you are not always so lucky. Sometimes you still
                        get one sad dot, which needs to be gradually transformed into a cross.
